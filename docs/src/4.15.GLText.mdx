# Text

`<GLText />` renders text in the 3D scene (unlike `<Text />`, which renders additional DOM nodes).

The prop types are identical to `<Text />`, except that additionally each Text object supports an optional `billboard?: boolean` property. If true (the default), text will always face the camera; if false, text may be rotated in 3D according to `pose.orientation`.

<GLText />

## Scale Invariance

`<GLText />` also supports rendering text at a constant scale regardless of the zoom level by using the optional `scaleInvariantFontSize?: number` property. If set (default is `undefined`), the text will be rendered always at the same size, resembling the behavior of the `<Text />` command. 

Please note that `scaleInvariantFontSize` only works if the `billboard` property is set to true.
